# A12: Product reviews

This assignment helps you practice with NoSQL database systems, specifically MongoDB. You will set up the database to store product reviews.

## Tasks

Use MongoDB to create a product review database. You may use PHP, as shown in the [MongoDB notes](/notes/mongodb.html), or some other language. Support the following features:

- Listing products. Show the average score for each product in the listing, as well as its title and description. Also show the # of reviews, with a link to read all reviews.
- Show a single product, with all its reviews (and each review's score).
- Support writing a new review, with a score, for a particular product.

You do not need to support product creation or deletion or updating. Likewise, you do not need to support changing or deleting reviews. You should create all the products ahead of time, perhaps using the `mongo` command line program.
