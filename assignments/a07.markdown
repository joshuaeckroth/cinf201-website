# A07: IMDB website

In this assignment, you will build a website that lets people browse the IMDB movie database.

## Tasks

Extend our IMDB website demonstrated in class. Start by making a directory:

```
mkdir A07
cd A07
```

Then copy my files:

```
cp -R /home/jeckroth/cinf201/webdemo/* .
```

Add these features:

1. A page showing the actors (firstname and lastname) & their character names in a movie, accessible at `/movies/<idmovies>`. Show the characters in order of billing position. Make sure this page is linked from each movie on the homepage. Include the movie title & year on the page.
2. A page showing the movies that an actor has acted in, including the character name & movie year & movie rating, accessible at `/actors/<idactors>`. The actor page should be linked for each actor on the list of actors from the movie page (task 1). Include the actor's name on the page.
3. Update the homepage to show the total count of movies and actors, above the table of top-rated movies.

Make all of your pages look attractive using standard Bootstrap styling. Read the bootstrap documentation at [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/).

## Flask ports

Run your website with the following command, but changing the port to your designated port:

```
FLASK_APP=main.py flask run --port=5026
```
