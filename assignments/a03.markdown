# A03: DeLand weather

This assignment helps you practice with more advanced "select" queries. Weâ€™ll use a dataset of DeLand's weather downloaded from [FSU's Climate Center](http://climatecenter.fsu.edu/climate-data-access-tools/downloadable-data). You will only query one table, weather_deland, in the cinf201 database.

## Tasks

In a single file named `A03.sql`, write "select" queries that meet the following criteria:

1. Show all fields from the 10 most recent records, ordered by date (most recent first).
2. Select the single hottest temperature; just report this temp.
3. Show the high temperature and year (in that order) for every christmas day (Dec 25); order by temp (highest first); ignore null high temps.
4. Show the month, avg\_temp, and precipitation for days where precipitation was greater than 5 inches; order by month (earlier months first); skip null values for avg\_temp.
5. Show year, precipitation, max\_temp, min\_temp, avg\_temp for every record with the same day and month as today, ordered by year (oldest first); ignore records where max\_temp is null.
6. Find the coldest Monday; report the min\_temp and recdate; ignore min\_temps that are null.

## Hints

For date-related queries (like day of week queries), refer to [MySQL's date and time functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html).
