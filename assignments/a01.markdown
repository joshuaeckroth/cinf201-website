# A01: NFL Play-by-play



## SQL script example

Create a text file named `a01.sql` and write your SQL queries in this
file, one per line. Be sure to finish each query with a
semicolon. Start with `use cinf201;` to be sure you are accessing the
correct database.

Here is an example:

~~~ sql
use cinf201;

select GameDate from nflpbp limit 10;

select Quarter, Minute, Down from nflpbp limit 10;
~~~

You can test your script in two ways:

- manually: on londo, run `mysql < a01.sql`
- using my testing script: on londo, run `cinf201-test a01`


## Submission

~~~
cinf201-submit a01
~~~
