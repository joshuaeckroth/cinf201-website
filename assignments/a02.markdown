# A02: Billboard Top 10

This assignment helps you practice "insert", "select", "update", and "delete" queries. We'll use a simple dataset of Billboard top songs for the [week of January 19, 2019](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/).

## Preparation

Here is the song data:

| Artist | Song | This week position | Last week position |
|-
| Post Malone & Swae Lee | Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse) | 1 | 3 |
| Halsey | Without Me | 2 | 1 |
| Ariana Grande | Thank U, Next | 3 | 2 |
| Travis Scott | Sicko Mode | 4 | 4 |
| Panic! At The Disco | High Hopes | 5 | 5 |
| Marshmello & Bastille | Happier | 6 | 6 |
| Maroon 5 Featuring Cardi B | Girls Like You | 7 | 7 |
| Lil Baby & Gunna | Drip Too Hard | 8 | 8 |
| Benny Blanco, Halsey, & Khalid | Eastside | 9 | 11 |
| Kodak Black Featuring Travis Scott & Offset | ZEZE | 10 | 9 |

## Required code

Include the following code at the top of your solution to ensure the table structure is created. Change "cinf201\_jeckroth" to your database name, i.e., "cinf201\_myusername".

~~~ sql
use cinf201_jeckroth;
drop table if exists billboard_top10;
create table billboard_top10 (
    artist varchar(200) not null,
    song varchar(200) not null,
    this_week_pos int not null,
    last_week_pos int
);
~~~

## Tasks

1. Insert all the song data listed in the table above, in the order shown in the table. Then run `select * from billboard_top10;` to show all the data in the order inserted.
2. Show all songs (artist and song name) that have moved up the chart over the week; keep the order of songs the same as the original table.
3. Swap the "this week" positions of Travis Scott and Ariana Grande songs. Don't change their "last week" positions. You might need multiple queries. Then run `select * from billboard_top10 order by this_week_pos;`
4. Show all data from songs that involve Halsey (either as sole artist or featured). Sort by this week pos, ascending.
5. Copy every "this week" position to "last week", then update all "this week" positions to 1+ their prior value. Eliminate any songs whose "this week" position is greater than 10. Then run `select * from billboard_top10 order by this_week_pos;`
6. Add a new song at position 1: artist = Rick Astley, song = Never Gonna Give You Up, this week pos = 1, last week pos = null. Then run `select * from billboard_top10 order by this_week_pos;`
