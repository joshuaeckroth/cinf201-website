# A02: Billboard Top 10

This assignment helps you practice "insert", "select", "update", and "delete" queries. We'll use a simple dataset of Billboard top songs for the [week of September 7, 2019](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/).

## Preparation

Here is the song data:

| Artist | Song | This week position | Two weeks ago |
|-
| Lizzo | Truth Hurts | 1 | 4 |
| Shawn Mendes & Camilia Cabello | Senorita | 2 | 2 |
| Billie Eilish | Bad Guy | 3 | 1 |
| Taylor Swift | You Need To Calm Down | 4 | 18 |
| Lil Nas X Featuring Billy Ray Cyrus | Old Town Road | 5 | 3 |
| Lil Tecca | Ran$om | 6 | 8 |
| Chris Brown Featuring Drake | No Guidance | 7 | 6 |
| Khalid | Talk | 8 | 5 |
| Ed Sheeran & Justin Bieber | I Don't Care | 9 | 7 |
| Taylor Swift | Lover | 10 | NULL |

## Required code

Include the following code at the top of your solution to ensure the table structure is created. Change "cinf201\_jeckroth" to your database name, i.e., "cinf201\_myusername".

~~~ sql
use cinf201_jeckroth;
drop table if exists billboard_top10;
create table billboard_top10 (
    artist varchar(200) not null,
    song varchar(200) not null,
    this_week_pos int not null,
    two_week_pos int
);
~~~

## Tasks

1. Insert all the song data listed in the table above, in the order shown in the table. Then run `select * from billboard_top10;` to show all the data in the order inserted.
2. Show all songs (artist and song name) that have moved up the chart over the two weeks; keep the order of songs the same as the original table.
3. Swap the "this week" positions of Lil Tecca and Billie Eilish songs. Don't change their "two weeks ago" positions. You might need multiple queries. Then run `select * from billboard_top10 order by this_week_pos;`
4. Show all data from songs by Taylor Swift. Sort by this week pos, ascending.
5. Copy every "this week" position to "two weeks ago", then update all "this week" positions to 1+ their prior value. Eliminate any songs whose "this week" position is greater than 10. Then run `select * from billboard_top10 order by this_week_pos;`
6. Add a new song at position 1: artist = Rick Astley, song = Never Gonna Give You Up, this week pos = 1, two weeks ago = null. Then run `select * from billboard_top10 order by this_week_pos;`
