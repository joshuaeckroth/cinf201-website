# Project

## Task

You may work alone or with one other person. You must meet the following requirements:

- Present your project during our "final exam" time.
- Create an application with a simple and easy-to-use interface.
- The application must serve a realistic purpose, and will be judged on its size -- it should be about 3x the work required for a single assignment.
- Use a database: MySQL or Mongo or another technology (approval required).
- Allow users to create, read, update, and delete data.
- Your project plans must be approved ahead of time.

## Grading

- Code (completness, functionality): 80%
- Presentation (completeness, clarity): 20%
