# A08: Backblaze

## Task

Using the delenn server (delenn.stetson.edu port 2222), and the files located at `/bigdata/data/backblaze` or the mysql table `backblaze` in the database `bigdata`, answer these questions:

- Which day had the largest number of installed drives, and what was this number?
- How many distinct drives (by model+serial) are installed (i.e., that exist in the data) in each year?
- How many failures occurred each year?
- Which model (not serial) has the most failures overall?

## Submission

Email me your list of commands. (We don't have a cinf201-submit program on delenn.)

## Notes from class

```
Linux commands:
- less: look at a file
- wc -l: count lines of file
- head, tail: show top/bottom of file
  - head -n 10: show first 10 lines
  - tail -n +10: show all but first 10 lines
  - tail -n -10: show last 10 lines
- cut: split lines by separator,
  keep certain columns
  - cut -d , -f 1,2: separate by comma,
    keep columns 1 & 2
- sort: sort lines
- uniq: keep only unique/distinct lines
  (lines must be sorted first)
- pipe ("|"): feed output of one command
  into input of next command
  - head -n 10 <filename> | wc -l
- grep: search for lines with a phrase
  - grep for simple phrases
  - grep for end of line: $
    - i.e., grep ',1$' file.csv
- time: put before a command, to measure
  how long it takes
- du -sh: count space required by files
- for loops:
  - for i in 1 2 4 56 7; do echo $i; done
  - for i in `echo 1 2 4 56 7`; do echo $i; done


Example Questions:
- How many records do we have?
  - 146mil
  - wc -l backblaze.csv
- How many drive-days per year? (rows per year)
  - for i in `ls -d 2*`; do echo $i; wc -l $i/*.csv | tail -n -1; done
- How many failures overall?
  - grep ',1$' backblaze.csv | wc -l
```
