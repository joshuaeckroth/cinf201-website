# A08: Registrar

This assignment helps you practice table design, constraints like foreign keys, and views. You will be asked to create a student registrar system.

Note, because this assignment has multiple possible solutions, there are no automated test cases or testing script.

## Tasks

Create tables and views and sample data to support these queries.

1. Show a Monday-Friday class schedule for a particular student (given a student id) and term (semester and year). Show each class, its day of week and starting/ending time of day, the class room, the faculty name who teaches the class, and the class name (e.g., CINF 201) and title (e.g., Database Systems).

2. Show a Monday-Friday class schedule for a particular faculty member (given a faculty id) and term (semester and year). Show each class, its day of week and starting/ending time of day, the class room, and the class name (e.g., CINF 201) and title (e.g., Database Systems).

3. Show the number of students enrolled for every course for a particular term (semester and year).

4. Show a list of student names that are enrolled in some particular class (class name, e.g., CINF 201) for a particular term (semester and year).

5. Show all courses in some term (semester and year) that use a particular room (e.g., Eliz 205). Show the times of day and days of week they use the room.

Further requirements:

- Create a normalized table design.
- Each query above (1-5) must be defined as a view.
- Give two examples for each query above (1-5), e.g., query #1 with two different student ids.
- Create enough sample data to have at least 3 rows for each query above. Use INSERT statements in your SQL file to create the sample data.
- Create indexes as appropriate.
