# Joins

- high
- level
- points

## Motivation

there is no difference among left/right inner/outer joins if both tables always have pointers to the other table; e.g., every product has a price and every price is associated with some product.

instead, consider vehicles and owners: not every person owns a vehicle, but every vehicle has an owner (perhaps the dealer or bank)

(show diagrams)

now consider pets and species of birds: not every pet is a bird, and not every species of bird is a pet

(show diagrams)


where clause is checked after the join has occurred
