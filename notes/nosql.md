# NoSQL

NoSQL databases typically abandon the need for tables and foreign keys. Instead, they take one of several possible approaches. Some like Redis use very simple key/value pairs for all data, some like MongoDB use a "document" concept which are collected in "collections," and some use a graph structure where each bit of data can link to any other bit of data.
