# Database systems



## Taxonomy of database systems

according to the data model

hierarchical (ibm ims, filesystems)
graph (neo4j, orientdb)
relational (mysql, oracle, postgresql)
key-value pairs (redis, riak)
object-oriented (cache)
document-oriented (mongo)

## History

why hierarchical failed (except for filesystems):

- "Hierarchical database systems are difficult to use. They require application developers to program navigation through the connected records [...]"
- "They also require developers to predict all possible access patterns in advance and design the database accordingly. A database access pattern that is not included in the design becomes very difficult and inefficient."
