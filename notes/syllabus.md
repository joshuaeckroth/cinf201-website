## Honor code

I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University.

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (822-7127; [www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can be contacted using the email address [asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
