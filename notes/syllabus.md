## Textbook

You will not need a textbook.

## Grading

- Attendance on work/demo days (usually Fridays): 5%
- Demos (2 required, 5 min each): 10%
- Homeworks (12 of them): 40%
- Quizzes (in class, on Wednesdays): 15%
- Group project: 30%

Late homework is penalized 20% for each day that it is
late. Submissions more than 3 days late receive no credit. Quizzes
cannot be made up unless a doctor's note is provided.

### Attendance

The plan is that every Friday will be a demo/work day. We will start
with demonstrations (you are required to give two demos during the
semester) and then proceed to work on the current homework or group
project. Attendance is required for these days to ensure that every
student is engaged with the material and making progress on
assignments.

The grading rubric for attendance is as follows, out of 3 points:

- attended at least 75% of work days: 3 pts
- attended at least 50% of work days: 2 pts
- attended at least 25% of work days: 1 pt
- attended fewer than 25% of work days: 0 pts

### Homework

Homework is assigned weekly until the group project starts. Most
assignments have a corresponding test script that you can use to check
your solution and I use to assist my grading.

The grading rubric for homework is as follows, out of 3 points:

- all tests pass (if tests are available) or solution meets all stated requirements: 3 pts
- at least 75% of tests pass or stated requirements are met: 2 pts
- at least 25% of tests pass or stated requirements are met: 1 pt
- no tests pass, no requirements met, or no submission: 0 pts

### Demos

You are required to give a 5 minute presentation on two separate
occassions about some new, interesting tool or technique relevant the
class as a whole (i.e., database systems). Your demos will be added to
the cookbooks that are available from this site.

The grading rubric for demos is as follows, out of 3 points:

- tool/technique is practical or interesting: +1 pt
- tool/technique is clearly presented: +1 pt
- tool/technique is novel: +1 pt

"Novel" means creative and new. A not-novel demo includes simple
variations of prior demos. Note, however, that presenting the same
tool/technique as someone else will receive no credit.

### Quizzes

During some, but not all, weeks during the semester, a paper-based
quiz will be given. The quiz will always take place on a
Wednesday. The quizzes will be short, requiring approximately 10
minutes to complete. They will always have 5 questions.

The grading rubric for quizzes is as follows, out of 3 points:

- 4 or 5 questions solved correctly: 3 pts
- 2 or 3 questions solved correctly: 2 pts
- 1 question solved correctly: 1 pt
- 0 questions sovled correctly or absent (did not take quiz): 0 pts

### Group project



## Honor code

I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University.

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (822-7127; [www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can be contacted using the email address [asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
